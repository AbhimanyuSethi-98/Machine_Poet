# Machine_Poet
A basic implementation of an RNN that learns poetry from your choice of favorite writer(s) using the Poetry Foundation Dateset of poems. The training data may consist of multiple poets as well so you can try to combine different styles for fun results (I know I have). Any inputs are very much appreciated
